# Infrastructure Brand Migration Checklist

This checklist ensures a safe and complete migration of all infrastructure-level brand references.

## Pre-Migration Setup ‚úÖ

### Planning & Documentation
- [x] Created migration documentation (`INFRASTRUCTURE_MIGRATION.md`)
- [x] Created migration script (`scripts/migrate-infrastructure-branding.js`)
- [x] Created test suite (`scripts/test-infrastructure-migration.js`)
- [x] Created data migration utilities (`src/utils/dataMigration.ts`)
- [x] Enhanced brand configuration (`src/config/brand.ts`)

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Test migration in development environment
- [ ] Test migration in staging environment
- [ ] Backup production data
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Alert users of potential session resets

## Phase 1: Low-Risk Infrastructure ‚è≥

### Database Class Names
- [ ] Update `LuckstrologyDatabase` ‚Üí `OrbitAndChillDatabase`
- [ ] Update `LuckstrologyDB` ‚Üí `OrbitAndChillDB`
- [ ] Verify database connections still work
- [ ] Test existing data accessibility

### User Agent Strings
- [ ] Update `Luckstrology-App/1.0` ‚Üí `OrbitAndChill-App/1.0`
- [ ] Test external API calls still work
- [ ] Verify geocoding services respond correctly

### Library Metadata
- [ ] Update author field to new brand
- [ ] Update homepage URL (when domain ready)
- [ ] Update repository URL (when ready)

### Legacy Component Cleanup
- [ ] Update or remove `src/app/discussions/page-db.tsx`
- [ ] Check for any other legacy files
- [ ] Remove unused imports and references

### Testing Phase 1
- [ ] Run test suite: `node scripts/test-infrastructure-migration.js`
- [ ] Verify no build errors
- [ ] Test core functionality works
- [ ] Check database operations

## Phase 2: Medium-Risk Infrastructure ‚è≥

### Session Keys
- [ ] Update `luckstrology_session` ‚Üí `orbitandchill_session`
- [ ] Coordinate with deployment to minimize user impact
- [ ] Test authentication flow works
- [ ] Verify session management

### Admin Default Settings
- [ ] Update default email addresses
- [ ] Test admin panel functionality
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Check SMTP configuration

### Testing Phase 2
- [ ] Test user login/logout flow
- [ ] Verify admin panel accessibility
- [ ] Check email functionality
- [ ] Monitor error logs

### User Communication
- [ ] Notify users of session reset requirement
- [ ] Provide timeline for migration
- [ ] Prepare support documentation

## Phase 3: High-Risk Data Migration ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Pre-Migration Data Safety
- [ ] Create comprehensive data backup
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedure
- [ ] Verify backup data integrity
- [ ] Document current data structure

### Storage Key Migration
- [ ] Deploy client migration script first
- [ ] Test data migration in staging
- [ ] Migrate `luckstrology-user-storage` ‚Üí `orbitandchill-user-storage`
- [ ] Migrate `luckstrology-events-storage` ‚Üí `orbitandchill-events-storage`
- [ ] Verify data preservation and accessibility

### IndexedDB Migration (If Applicable)
- [ ] Backup IndexedDB data
- [ ] Test database schema compatibility
- [ ] Migrate `LuckstrologyDB` ‚Üí `OrbitAndChillDB`
- [ ] Verify data integrity post-migration

### Code Updates
- [ ] Update storage key references in code
- [ ] Deploy code changes after data migration
- [ ] Test application functionality with new keys
- [ ] Monitor for data access errors

### Data Cleanup
- [ ] Verify all data migrated successfully
- [ ] Remove legacy storage keys (after confirmation)
- [ ] Clean up migration utilities
- [ ] Archive backup data

## Post-Migration Validation ‚úÖ

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] User data loads correctly
- [ ] Events and preferences preserved
- [ ] Chart history accessible
- [ ] All features working normally

### Data Integrity Check
- [ ] All user profiles intact
- [ ] Birth data preserved
- [ ] Saved charts accessible
- [ ] Settings and preferences maintained
- [ ] No data corruption detected

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Check application load times
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Verify database performance
- [ ] Check storage usage patterns

### User Experience
- [ ] Smooth login experience
- [ ] No data loss reported
- [ ] Features work as expected
- [ ] No breaking changes for users

## Documentation & Cleanup üìö

### Update Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new brand references
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update deployment guides
- [ ] Archive migration documentation

### Code Cleanup
