    challenge: "The obstacle may manifest as recurring patterns of abandoning projects or commitments when they require sustained effort, difficulty developing expertise or practical skills due to constant attraction to new possibilities, or avoiding responsibilities by claiming need for freedom or fear that commitment will limit your potential. You might find yourself constantly starting new things without developing depth or achieving meaningful accomplishments that require sustained focus and practical development.",
    advice: "Work on developing practical commitment and sustained effort in areas that truly matter to you while maintaining your natural openness to new possibilities and experiences. Practice choosing consciously when to explore and when to deepen your commitment and expertise, and learn that some limitations actually serve greater freedom by developing capabilities that expand your real options. Balance your love of possibility with practical development that allows your unlimited potential to manifest in concrete accomplishments and meaningful service."
