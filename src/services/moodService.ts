- Use casual internet typing style (lowercase, missing punctuation, etc.)
- Keep it 1-3 sentences maximum
- Include natural typing imperfections

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the reply text itself, nothing else. Do not include JSON formatting, explanations, or meta-commentary. Just write the actual reply as ${username} would type it.`;
