# Signs Interpretation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for the Signs chapter from John Frawley's "The Horary Textbook". The Signs tab will be the fourth interpretation tab in our horary system, focusing on zodiacal sign characteristics and their practical applications in chart interpretation.

## Core Concepts from Frawley's Signs Chapter

### Fundamental Principle
**Signs as Adjectives**: In astrological sentences, planets are nouns, signs are adjectives, and aspects are verbs. Signs describe planets but have no power to act independently.

### Three Ways Signs Describe Planets
1. **Essential Strength** - How much dignity the planet has (covered in later chapter)
2. **Attitude to Other Planets** - Reception relationships (covered in later chapter)  
3. **Inherent Qualities** - Shared characteristics within sign groups (focus of this chapter)

### Important Traditional Perspective
- Signs do NOT have the "rounded personalities" of modern astrology
- Example: Planet in Leo behaves in a "feral" way (wild beast), NOT regal
- Cannot be both feral and regal simultaneously
- Context determines which quality manifests

## Sign Classification Systems

### 1. Gender Classification

#### Male Signs
**Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius**
- **Primary Use**: Determining sex of babies or thieves
- **Secondary Use**: Distinguishing between candidates ("Which employee should I hire?")
- **Application**: When need to differentiate multiple options by gender

#### Female Signs  
**Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces**
- **Same applications as male signs**
- **Useful for identification in questions with multiple people**

### 2. Elemental Classification

#### Earth Signs: **Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn**
- **Qualities**: Cold and dry
- **Primary Use**: Locating lost objects (underground, buried, in earth)
- **Vocational**: Farmer, gardener, builder, miner
- **Weather**: Cold, dry conditions

#### Air Signs: **Gemini, Libra, Aquarius**
- **Qualities**: Hot and moist  
- **Primary Use**: Lost objects in high places, intellectual pursuits
- **Vocational**: Accountant (relates to reason), lawyer, teacher, communicator
- **Weather**: Windy, changeable conditions

#### Fire Signs: **Aries, Leo, Sagittarius**
- **Qualities**: Hot and dry
- **Primary Use**: Objects near heat, fire, or energy sources
- **Vocational**: Chef, metallurgist, athlete, soldier
- **Weather**: Hot, dry conditions

#### Water Signs: **Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces**
- **Qualities**: Cold and moist
- **Primary Use**: Objects near water, liquids, wells, rivers
- **Vocational**: Sailor, fisherman, brewer, nurse
- **Weather**: Wet, humid conditions

### 3. Modal Classification

#### Cardinal Signs: **Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn**
- **Character**: Quick action that doesn't last
- **Medical**: Acute illness (comes on quickly)
- **Disputes**: "Show you mean business and opponent will give in"
- **General**: Fast start, short duration

#### Fixed Signs: **Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius**
- **Character**: Slow and stable
- **Medical**: Chronic illness (long-lasting)
- **Disputes**: "Will fight it out to the end"
- **Job Security**: Strong testimony for stability
- **General**: Enduring, persistent, stubborn

#### Mutable Signs: **Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces**
- **Character**: Come and go, changeable
- **Medical**: Illness that comes and goes
- **Reliability**: Less inclined to be reliable or honest
- **General**: Adaptable, inconsistent, variable

### 4. Double-Bodied Signs

#### The Mutable Signs (Emphasis on Duality)
**Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces ONLY**
- **Employment**: Transition from steady job to freelancing/part-time
- **Relationships**: When unclear if 1st house = individual or couple
- **Numbers**: More than one (babies, thieves, objects)
- **Key Concept**: Duality, splitting, multiple aspects

### 5. Fertility Classification

#### Fertile Signs
**Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces (Water signs)**
- **Procreation**: Strong testimony for having children
- **Investments**: More likely to grow and prosper
- **Growth**: General increase and abundance

#### Barren Signs
**Gemini, Leo, Virgo**
- **Procreation**: Testimony against having children
- **Note**: Gemini and Virgo are also double-bodied, so if chart shows "Yes" to children, indicates more than one
- **Investments**: Less likely to grow

#### Neutral Signs
**Aries, Taurus, Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius**
- **Neither particularly fertile nor barren**

### 6. Voice Classification

#### Mute Signs
**Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces (Water signs)**
- **Vocational**: Not suitable for speaking roles
- **Communication**: Silent, secretive, internal processing
- **Example**: Heart in mute sign = unexpressed love

#### Loud-Voiced Signs
**Gemini, Virgo, Libra**
- **Vocational**: Singer, teacher, announcer, lawyer
- **Communication**: Outspoken, vocal, heard by others
- **Example**: Head in loud-voiced sign = criticism is heard

#### Half-Voiced Signs
**Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius**
- **Moderate speaking ability**

#### Weak-Voiced Signs
**Capricorn, Aquarius**
- **Quiet, subdued communication**

### 7. Human/Animal Classification

#### Humane Signs
**Gemini, Libra, Aquarius (Air signs) + Virgo**
- **Behavior**: Reasonable, civilized, human-like responses
- **Negotiations**: Will behave rationally
- **Example**: Neighbor's significator in humane sign = reasonable response to complaints

#### Bestial Signs
**Aries, Taurus, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn**
- **Behavior**: Animal-like, instinctual responses
- **Negotiations**: May act unreasonably

#### Feral Signs
**Leo and second half of Sagittarius**
- **Behavior**: Wild, uncontrolled, dangerous responses  
- **Extreme form of bestial behavior**

### 8. Maimed Signs
**Aries, Taurus, Leo, Pisces**
- **Physical descriptions**: May indicate physical limitations or injuries
- **Limited practical use in most questions**

## Body Parts Ruled by Signs

### Head to Toe Progression
- **Aries**: Head
- **Taurus**: Neck  
- **Gemini**: Hands, arms, shoulders
- **Cancer**: Breast
- **Leo**: Heart and ribs
- **Virgo**: Intestines and related organs
- **Libra**: Urinary system, lower back
- **Scorpio**: Genitals and anus
- **Sagittarius**: Thighs and buttocks
- **Capricorn**: Knees
- **Aquarius**: Calves and ankles
- **Pisces**: Feet

## Practical Application Principles

### Context-Dependent Interpretation
- All testimonies are "all things being equal"
- Any single testimony can be outweighed
- Use common sense in application
- **Example**: Planet at end of fixed sign = stable situation coming to an end

### Simple Judgments
- Sometimes sign characteristics alone provide sufficient answer
- **Example**: "Is my job secure?" with Lord 10 in middle of fixed sign = "Yes"
- Check for contrary testimonies, but don't overcomplicate

### Multiple Characteristics
- Signs can have multiple relevant characteristics
- Choose the most contextually appropriate
- **Example**: Ivy ruled by Jupiter (spreads) AND Saturn (dark places, decay)

## Implementation Strategy

### Data Structures
```typescript
interface SignCharacteristics {
  sign: string;
  gender: 'masculine' | 'feminine';
  element: 'fire' | 'earth' | 'air' | 'water';
  mode: 'cardinal' | 'fixed' | 'mutable';
  fertility: 'fertile' | 'barren' | 'neutral';
  voice: 'mute' | 'loud' | 'half' | 'weak';
  humanity: 'humane' | 'bestial' | 'feral';
  bodyPart: string;
  isDoubleBodydied: boolean;
  isMaimed: boolean;
  qualities: string[];
  vocationaApplicatons: string[];
  medicalSignificance: string[];
}
```

### UI Components
