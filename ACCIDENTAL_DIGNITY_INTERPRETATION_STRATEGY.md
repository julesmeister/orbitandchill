# Accidental Dignity Interpretation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for the Accidental Dignity chapter from John Frawley's "The Horary Textbook". The Accidental Dignity tab will be the sixth interpretation tab in our horary system, focusing on planetary power to act in practice, complementing essential dignity.

## Core Concepts from Frawley's Accidental Dignity Chapter

### Fundamental Principle: Power vs. Morality
**Essential Dignity** shows **whether that planet signifies something good or bad**
**Accidental Dignity** shows **whether this thing, good or bad, has power to act**

Example: Planet in own sign (essential dignity) = knows how to drive
Planet on Midheaven (accidental dignity) = in the driving seat
Both together = capable driver in control

### Football Manager Analogy
- Two players with lots of essential dignity (good players)
- Player A: Fired up for England selection (accidental dignity)
- Player B: Mother died last week (accidental debility)
- Manager must consider both skill AND current condition

### Philosophical Foundation
- Essential dignity = moral quality and inherent nature
- Accidental dignity = practical power and ability to manifest
- In practice, this distinction often blurs but provides crucial starting point
- Context determines relevance of specific dignities/debilities

## The Accidental Dignity System

### 1. House Placement (Most Important)
**General Rule**: Angular houses strong; succedent houses middling; cadent houses weak

**Power Classification**:
- **Angular Houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th)**: Strong - planets have power to act
- **Succedent Houses (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th)**: Middling power
- **Cadent Houses (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th)**: Weak power

**Special Cases**:
- **3rd and 9th houses**: Honorary succedents (stronger than other cadents)
- **8th house**: As weak as 6th or 12th despite being succedent
- **6th, 8th, 12th**: Always weak regardless of classification

**Simplified Rule**:
- **Angular houses**: Strong
- **6th, 8th, 12th**: Weak
- **Others**: Neutral

**Contextual Override**: Planet gains strength if question gives good reason to be in that house
Example: "Will I recover loaned money?" - Lord 1 in 8th house (other person's money) is appropriate, not weak

**Proximity to Cusp**: Closer to angular cusp = more strength
**Sign Consideration**: Planet in different sign from house cusp has "layer of insulation"

### 2. Joy (Minor Dignity)
**Planetary Joys** - each planet finds one house congenial:
- **Mercury**: 1st house (communication, thought)
- **Moon**: 3rd house (local environment, siblings)  
- **Venus**: 5th house (pleasure, creativity)
- **Mars**: 6th house (work, conflict)
- **Sun**: 9th house (higher learning, religion)
- **Jupiter**: 11th house (friends, hopes)
- **Saturn**: 12th house (isolation, endings)

**Effect**: Planet "feels better about itself" and has more power to act according to its nature

### 3. Retrograde Motion (Context-Dependent)
**Not Always a Debility**: Depends entirely on question context

**Favorable Contexts** (retrograde is good):
- "Will I get my old job back?"
- "Can I get back with Britney?"
- "Will the cat come home?"
- Any situation involving returning or going back

**Law of Sufficient Explanation**: If context explains the "debility," it's not a debility

**Unfavorable Contexts**: When no return is sought or relevant
- "Going the wrong way: against nature"
- "Shooting in the wrong direction" - powerful debility

**Retrograde Analysis**: Consider what planet was previously doing and returning to do again

### 4. Station (Extreme Weakness)
**First Station**: Turning retrograde - "feeling so ill he takes to his sickbed"
**Second Station**: Turning direct - "getting up from sickbed, weak but improving"

**Effect**: Time of great weakness and vulnerability
**Exception**: Only strongest extenuating circumstances render planet capable of action

**Contextual Analysis**: 
- Maybe avoiding opposing Saturn (smart move)
- Maybe avoiding/failing to gain essential dignity
- Consider change of reception at sign boundaries

### 5. Speed (Impetus and Power)
**General Rule**: Faster = more power to act (like physics: more speed = more impact)

**Average Daily Motions**:
- **Moon**: 13°11'
- **Mercury**: 0°59' 
- **Venus**: 0°59'
- **Sun**: 0°59' (never significantly fast/slow)
- **Mars**: 0°31'
- **Jupiter**: 0°05'
- **Saturn**: 0°02'

**Speed Classifications**:
- **Moon**: Fast >14°30', Slow <12°30'
- **Mercury**: Fast >1°30', Slow <1°00'
- **Venus**: Fast >1°00', Slow <0°50'
- **Mars**: Fast >0°40', Slow <0°30'
- **Jupiter**: Fast >0°10', Slow <0°05'
- **Saturn**: Fast >0°05', Slow <0°02'

**Special Case - Saturn**: Fast motion is against Saturn's ponderous nature = weakness
**Context Relevance**: "Will I gain by dragging this case out?" - slow planet may be favorable

### 6. Combustion (Extreme Debility)
**Definition**: Planet within 8.5 degrees of Sun in same sign
**Effect**: "No greater affliction" - utterly destructive

**Severity Factors**:
- **Distance**: Closer = worse
- **Motion**: Applying = worse than separating
- **Same sign requirement**: Must be in same sign as Sun

**Positive Uses of Combustion**:
- **Invisibility**: "Can I do this without a permit?" - combust = "no one can see you"
- **Lost Objects**: Often found when significator leaves combustion in real time
- **Cannot See Reason**: Combust person won't listen to advice

**Special Cases**:
- **Mars Combustion**: Affects Mars like any other planet (contra some claims)
- **Conjunction Gives Yes**: If conjunction with Sun gives positive answer, ignore combustion
- **Mutual Reception**: Planet in own sign combust = mutual reception with Sun (power balance)
- **Applying vs Separating**: "Will I survive illness?" - applying = dangerous, separating = worst is past

### 7. Cazimi (Extreme Dignity)
**Definition**: Planet within 17' of exact conjunction with Sun (in heart of Sun)
**Effect**: "Best thing that can happen to a planet"
**Result**: Planet becomes invincible, crowned with royal power

### 8. Under the Sunbeams (Mild Debility)
**Definition**: Planet within 15 degrees of Sun but not combust
**Effect**: Mild debility, weakened but not destroyed
**Recovery**: Planet gains strength as it moves away from Sun

### 9. Besiegement (Context-Dependent)
**Definition**: Planet placed between two other planets

**Malefic Besiegement**: Between Mars and Saturn
- "Rock and hard place"
- Destructive pressure from both sides
- Closer the besiegers = stronger the effect

**Benefic Besiegement**: Between Jupiter and Venus  
- "Cushion and very soft place"
- Competing gifts and support

**Condition Matters**: Dignified malefics less harmful than debilitated benefics

**Besiegement by Rays**: Planet casts aspect between two besiegers (much weaker effect)

### 10. Aspects from Other Planets
**Not Simple Benefic/Malefic**: Must consider:
- **Essential dignity** of aspecting planet
- **Role in chart** (strongly dignified Jupiter can still signify death)
- **Reception** between planets
- **Strength** of aspecting planet

**Example**: Jupiter in Cancer (strong) aspecting Saturn - but Jupiter in Cancer is in Saturn's detriment, so won't help Saturn much

### 11. Fixed Stars (Major)
**Three Stars of Major Significance**:

**Regulus (29° Leo)**:
- Great power for material achievement
- Brings success but not necessarily happiness
- Will to power and material dominance

**Spica (23° Libra)**:
- Generally fortunate
- Protective influence
- Much happier than Regulus
- "Even if things don't work out, consequences won't be so bad"

**Caput Algol (26° Taurus)**:
- Brings difficulties
- "Losing one's head" literally or metaphorically
- Unfortunate results from rash actions

**Application**: Conjunction within 2 degrees to significator or house cusp (especially Ascendant)

### 12. The Nodes (House Effects)
**North Node**: Benefits affairs of that house OR shows querent benefiting through that house
**South Node**: Harms affairs of that house OR shows querent losing through that house

**Examples**:
- "Will I get the job?" + North Node in 10th = good for querent if she gets it (doesn't improve chances)
- "Should I employ this builder?" + South Node in 6th (servants) = No!

**Important**: Nodes come as pairs - avoid contradictory interpretations
**Relevance**: Only consider if Node falls in house that concerns the question

### 13. Lunar Conditions
**Light of Moon**:
- **More light = stronger** (closer to full)
- **Increasing light > decreasing light** (new to full > full to new)
- **Optimum**: Around separating trine to Sun (lots of light, still increasing)
- **Full Moon weakness**: Opposition to Sun creates weakness despite maximum light

**Void of Course Moon**:
- **Definition**: Makes no more aspects before leaving current sign
- **Effect**: "Not much is going to happen"
- **Can provide complete answer**: "Will I lose my job?" / "Will I win lottery?" = No, nothing happens
- **Not absolute**: Can be overruled by strong applying significators
- **Long Travel**: Even in same sign, if 15+ degrees to next aspect = effectively void
- **Feral Moon**: Travels entire sign without aspects = "like wild beast"

**Via Combusta (15° Libra to 15° Scorpio)**:
- **Affects Moon only**
- **Doesn't weaken but distresses**
- **Emotional turbulence** and unpleasant feelings
- **Consider position**: entering, stuck in middle, or leaving
