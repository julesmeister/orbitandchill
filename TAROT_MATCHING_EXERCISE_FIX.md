# Tarot Matching Exercise Progress Tracking Fix

## Problem Summary
The tarot matching exercise was not updating user progress (total points) or individual card mastery despite completing games. The issue was a database system incompatibility between the matching exercise and the API endpoints.

## Root Cause
The matching exercise was using two different database systems:
1. **TarotMatchingExercise** called `/api/tarot/evaluate` which used **Turso HTTP client** ✅
2. **TarotMatchingExercise** called `/api/tarot/award-points` which used **Drizzle ORM** ❌

According to `/API_DATABASE_PROTOCOL.md`, we should never use Drizzle ORM and must use Turso HTTP client instead.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/api/tarot/award-points/route.ts`
**Problem**: Was using Drizzle ORM instead of Turso HTTP client

**Solution**: Completely rewrote to use Turso HTTP client
- Removed Drizzle ORM imports (`@/db`, `tarotProgress`, `eq`, `sql`)
- Added Turso HTTP client import (`@libsql/client/http`)
- Implemented direct database connection using environment variables
- Added proper leaderboard updates using raw SQL queries
- Added username lookup for new leaderboard entries
- Added graceful fallback when database credentials unavailable

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD (Drizzle ORM - BROKEN)
import { db } from '@/db';
import { tarotProgress } from '@/db/schema';
const result = await db.insert(tarotProgress).values({...}).onConflictDoUpdate({...});

// NEW (Turso HTTP client - WORKING)
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client/http';
const client = createClient({ url: databaseUrl, authToken: authToken });
await client.execute({
  sql: `UPDATE tarot_leaderboard SET total_score = ? WHERE user_id = ?`,
  args: [newTotalScore, userId]
});
```

### 2. `/src/app/api/tarot/evaluate/route.ts`
**Problem**: Didn't handle `overrideScore` parameter from matching exercise

**Solution**: Added support for overrideScore parameter
- Updated `EvaluateRequest` interface to include `overrideScore?: number`
- Modified POST handler to use overrideScore when provided
- Maintained backward compatibility with regular AI evaluation

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Added to interface
interface EvaluateRequest {
  // ... existing fields
  overrideScore?: number; // Allow matching exercise to override score
}

// Added to POST handler
if (typeof overrideScore === 'number') {
  // Matching exercise provides its own score
  finalScore = overrideScore;
  feedback = `Matching exercise result: ${finalScore}% accuracy`;
} else {
  // Use AI to evaluate the interpretation
  const aiEvaluation = await generateAIEvaluation(interpretation, cardMeaning, cardKeywords, situation, aiConfig);
  finalScore = aiEvaluation.score;
  feedback = `${aiEvaluation.feedback}\n\nEXPERT EXAMPLE:\n${aiEvaluation.sampleInterpretation}\n\nTRADITIONAL MEANING:\n${cardMeaning}`;
}
```

## How the Matching Exercise Works

### Data Flow
1. **User completes matching exercise** in `TarotMatchingExercise.tsx`
2. **Individual card progress** tracked via `/api/tarot/evaluate` with `overrideScore`
3. **Total points awarded** via `/api/tarot/award-points` 
4. **Database updates** both individual card mastery and total user score

### Database Operations
The matching exercise now properly updates:
- **Individual card progress** (`tarot_progress` table) - upright/reversed mastery percentages
- **Total user score** (`tarot_leaderboard` table) - overall points and ranking

### API Endpoints Used
- **`/api/tarot/evaluate`** - Records individual card attempts with matching scores
- **`/api/tarot/award-points`** - Awards total points to user's leaderboard entry

## Testing the Fix

### Before Fix
- Matching exercise completed but no progress updated
- Total score remained unchanged
- Individual card mastery percentages not updated
- No database entries created

### After Fix
- Matching exercise updates both individual card progress and total score
- Leaderboard entries created/updated correctly
- Card mastery percentages reflect matching performance
- All database operations use consistent Turso HTTP client

### How to Test
1. Complete a matching exercise in the tarot learning section
2. Check that total score increases in user progress
3. Verify individual card mastery percentages update
4. Confirm leaderboard reflects new scores

## Database Schema Context

The matching exercise interacts with these tables:
- **`tarot_progress`** - Individual card mastery tracking
- **`tarot_leaderboard`** - Global user rankings and total scores
- **`tarot_sessions`** - Individual game session records

All use snake_case column names in database but camelCase in TypeScript interfaces.

- `/src/components/tarot/TarotMatchingExercise.tsx` - Main matching exercise component

## Implementation Notes
- Both endpoints now use identical database connection patterns
- Error handling includes graceful fallbacks when database unavailable
- Username lookup implemented for new leaderboard entries
- Proper TypeScript interfaces maintain type safety
- Console logging added for debugging progress tracking

## Future Considerations
- Consider consolidating both operations into a single endpoint
- Add retry logic for database operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add more detailed progress tracking analytics
