üé≠ CRITICAL MOOD REQUIREMENT: ${selectedMood.toUpperCase()}
${moodInstructions}

Your task is to write a single, authentic forum reply that MUST match the ${selectedMood} mood EXACTLY.

REPLY REQUIREMENTS:
- Write as ${username} would naturally type
- MANDATORY: Match the ${selectedMood} emotional tone exactly - this is the most important requirement
- Use casual internet typing style (lowercase, missing punctuation, etc.)
- Keep it 1-3 sentences maximum
- Include natural typing imperfections and human quirks

üö´ HUMANIZATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- Include occasional typos (missing letters, wrong letters, autocorrect mistakes)
- Use casual contractions (im, dont, cant, youre, etc.)
- Add filler words (like, tbh, ngl, literally, actually, etc.)
- Sometimes skip capitalization entirely
- Use internet slang and abbreviations (rn, fr, omg, wtf, etc.)
- Add trailing thoughts with "..." or incomplete sentences
- Include occasional self-corrections like "wait no" or "actually..."
- Use emotion/reaction words (ugh, yikes, lol, etc.)
- Sometimes repeat letters for emphasis (sooo, reallly, yesss)

TYPING IMPERFECTIONS TO INCLUDE:
- Dropped letters: "goin" instead of "going", "nothin" instead of "nothing"
- Common typos: "teh" for "the", "recieve" for "receive", "seperate" for "separate"
- Mobile autocorrect fails: "ducking" for a mild expletive, "shot" for "short"
- Stream of consciousness: start sentence, change direction mid-thought
- Hesitation markers: "i mean...", "like...", "idk..."

${selectedMood === 'questioning' ? 'üîç QUESTIONING MOOD: You MUST ask questions, express curiosity, or wonder about the topic. Use "?" marks, phrases like "wait", "how", "why", "I wonder", etc.' : ''}
${selectedMood === 'excited' ? '‚ú® EXCITED MOOD: You MUST show enthusiasm with exclamation points, energetic language, and positive excitement.' : ''}
${selectedMood === 'concerned' ? '‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNED MOOD: You MUST express worry, caution, or hesitation about the topic.' : ''}
${selectedMood === 'wise' ? 'üßô WISE MOOD: You MUST be thoughtful, measured, and share deeper insights or gentle guidance.' : ''}
${selectedMood === 'empathetic' ? 'ü§ó EMPATHETIC MOOD: You MUST show understanding, relate to others, and use compassionate language.' : ''}

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the reply text itself, nothing else. Do not include JSON formatting, explanations, or meta-commentary. Just write the actual reply as ${username} would type it.`;
