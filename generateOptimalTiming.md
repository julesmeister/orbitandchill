# generateOptimalTiming Algorithm Documentation

## Overview
The `generateOptimalTiming` function has been refactored into a modular architecture located at `/src/hooks/optimalTiming/`. This hook analyzes astrological configurations throughout a given month to find the most favorable times for specific life activities based on user-selected priorities.

## Architecture Update (January 2025 - Modular Refactor)
- **Hook Location**: `/src/hooks/useOptimalTiming.ts` (re-exports from modular structure)
- **Implementation Directory**: `/src/hooks/optimalTiming/`
- **Module Structure**:
  - `index.ts` - Main hook implementation and orchestration
  - `types.ts` - Type definitions for timing priorities, events, and analysis
  - `priorities.ts` - Priority criteria configurations (career, love, money, etc.)
  - `chartAnalyzers.ts` - Chart analysis logic for different timing methods
  - `titleGenerators.ts` - Astrological event title generation
  - `astrologicalUtils.ts` - Utility functions (time windows, moon phases, dignity)
  - `electionalProhibitions.ts` - Traditional electional astrology rules
- **Usage**: `/src/app/events/page.tsx` uses the `useOptimalTiming` hook
- **Benefits**: Better modularity, easier testing, clearer separation of concerns

## Algorithm Flow

### 1. Input Validation
- Checks if at least one priority is selected
- Verifies user has complete birth data for accurate calculations
- Clears existing generated events before creating new ones

### 2. Time Scanning Strategy
The algorithm scans each day of the target month at **24 different times** (every hour):
- 00:00, 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00
- 06:00, 07:00, 08:00, 09:00, 10:00, 11:00
- 12:00, 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00, 17:00
- 18:00, 19:00, 20:00, 21:00, 22:00, 23:00

This results in `daysInMonth × 24` total calculations per month (~720 calculations for a 30-day month).

### 3. Planetary Position Calculation
For each date/time combination:
```javascript
const chartData = await calculatePlanetaryPositions(testDate, latitude, longitude);
```
This returns:
- Planet positions in zodiac signs
- House placements (1-12)
- Planetary aspects (relationships between planets)

### 4. Priority-Based Scoring System

#### Priority Criteria Structure
Each priority (career, love, money, etc.) has:
- **favorablePlanets**: Which planets support this area
- **favorableHouses**: Which houses are beneficial
- **favorableAspects**: Which planetary relationships help
- **weight**: Multipliers for different planets/houses

#### Example: Money Priority
```javascript
money: {
  favorablePlanets: ['jupiter', 'venus', 'sun'],
  favorableHouses: [2, 8], // 2nd house (wealth), 8th house (investments)
  favorableAspects: ['trine', 'sextile', 'conjunction'],
  weight: {
    jupiter: 2.0,  // Jupiter strongly associated with abundance
    venus: 1.5,    // Venus brings material comfort
    sun: 1.2,      // Sun represents success
    house2: 2.0,   // 2nd house directly rules money
    house8: 1.8    // 8th house rules shared resources
  }
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Scoring Algorithm (`analyzeChartForPriorities`)

The scoring system now incorporates **planetary dignities and debilities** to better assess planetary strength:

#### Dignity Scoring Multipliers:
- **Rulership**: 1.5x (planet in its ruling sign - strongest)
- **Exaltation**: 1.3x (planet in its exalted sign - very strong)
- **Neutral**: 1.0x (baseline planetary strength)
- **Detriment**: 0.7x (planet in opposing sign - weakened)
- **Fall**: 0.5x (planet in weakest sign - most challenging)

For each selected priority:

1. **House Placement Scoring with Dignity**:
   - Checks if favorable planets are in favorable houses
   - Score = planetWeight × houseWeight × dignityMultiplier
   - Example: Jupiter (2.0) in 2nd house (2.0) in Cancer (exaltation 1.3x) = 5.2 points
   - Example: Jupiter (2.0) in 2nd house (2.0) in Capricorn (fall 0.5x) = 2.0 points

2. **Aspect Scoring with Dignity**:
   - Checks favorable aspects between favorable planets
   - Dignity multiplier = average of both planets' dignity scores
   - Score = (planet1Weight + planet2Weight) × 0.5 × dignityMultiplier
   - Example: Jupiter (exalted, 1.3x) trine Venus (neutral, 1.0x) = (2.0 + 1.5) × 0.5 × 1.15 = 2.01 points

3. **Total Score**:
   - Sum of all dignity-enhanced house placement and aspect scores
   - Capped at 10 for normalization
   - Higher quality timing due to planetary strength consideration

### 6. Result Selection and Distribution

#### Score Threshold  
**Current thresholds (as of January 2025):**
- Houses mode: ≥ 0.8
- Aspects mode: ≥ 0.5  
- Electional mode: ≥ 0.6

**Note:** These low thresholds accommodate Magic Formula individual planet bonuses even when the core formula isn't active.

#### Enhanced Distribution Strategy (Updated)
With 24-hour scanning, the algorithm now uses a **tiered distribution** approach:

1. **Excellent Results (Score 8+)**:
   - Takes ALL results with scores 8 or higher
   - No artificial limits on excellent timing

2. **Good Results (Score 6-7)**:
   - Up to 3 per day if no excellent results exist
   - Up to 2 additional per day if excellent results already exist
   - Maintains variety while allowing multiple good times per day

3. **Decent Results (Score 4-5)**:
   - One per day for days with no good/excellent results
   - Ensures every day has at least some opportunity if available

4. **No Artificial Cap**:
   - Removed the 12-result limit
   - Calendar can now show many more optimal times
   - Better utilizes the increased scanning frequency

### 7. Title Generation Algorithm

The `generateAstrologicalTitle` function creates meaningful titles based on the strongest astrological factor:

1. **Placement Analysis**:
   - Finds all significant planetary placements
   - Sorts by weighted importance
   - Example: "Jupiter 2nd" for Jupiter in 2nd house

2. **Variety for Money Priority**:
   - Special handling to alternate between 2nd and 8th house
   - Uses event index for predictable alternation
   - Ensures both wealth and investment opportunities shown

3. **Fallback Options**:
   - Aspect descriptions if no strong house placements
   - Priority labels as last resort

## Issue Resolved: Calendar Showing Fewer Entries After Hourly Scanning

### The Problem:
After implementing 24-hour scanning (vs 6 times per day), users noticed fewer entries in the calendar despite generating much more data (720 vs 180 calculations).

### Root Cause:
The **distribution strategy** was still using the old limits designed for sparse data:
- Fixed 12-result cap regardless of available quality results
- Weekly distribution taking only top 3 per week
- Single result per day restriction

### The Fix:
Implemented **Enhanced Tiered Distribution**:
- ALL excellent results (score 8+) are included
- Multiple good results (6-7) per day allowed
- Decent results (4-5) fill in gaps
- No artificial result cap

### Result:
Calendar now shows 20-50+ optimal timing opportunities per month instead of just 12.

## Previous Issue: Why Few Jupiter 2nd House Days in June?

### Potential Reasons (Now Resolved):

1. **Jupiter's Slow Movement**:
   - Jupiter changes signs approximately once per year
   - Changes houses slowly based on daily rotation
   - May not be in 2nd house during the scanned time windows

2. **House Calculation Timing**:
   - Houses rotate every 24 hours
   - 2nd house position depends on:
     - User's birth location (latitude/longitude)
     - Time of day
   - Jupiter might be in 2nd house at times not scanned (e.g., 3 AM)

3. **Competition with 8th House**:
   - Algorithm alternates between 2nd and 8th house titles
   - Even if Jupiter is in 2nd house multiple times, half might show as 8th house

4. **Score Threshold**:
   - Needs score e 4 to be included
   - Jupiter in 2nd alone might not reach threshold without supporting aspects

### Debugging Recommendations:

1. **Add More Time Slots**:
   ```javascript
   const timesToTest = ['00:00', '03:00', '06:00', '09:00', '12:00', '15:00', '18:00', '21:00'];
   ```

2. **Log House Positions**:
   The algorithm already logs planetary houses for first 3 days at noon. Check these logs to see where Jupiter actually is.

3. **Lower Score Threshold**:
   Try `if (score >= 3)` to see more results and understand score distribution.

4. **Remove Title Alternation**:
   Comment out the alternation logic (lines 306-310) to see all actual 2nd house placements.

5. **Add House Coverage Analysis**:
   Track which houses each planet visits throughout the month to identify patterns.

## Performance Considerations

- **Calculation Volume**: 720-744 calculations per month (30-31 days × 24 hours)
- **Memory Management**: 50ms delay between days to prevent memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Continues scanning even if individual calculations fail
- **Async Processing**: Uses Promise delays to prevent UI blocking
- **Enhanced Results**: Now typically returns 20-50+ events per month (vs previous 12)
- **Calendar Density**: Much better coverage of optimal timing opportunities

## Summary

The enhanced algorithm now provides comprehensive astrological timing analysis:

### Improvements Made:
- **Complete Time Coverage**: 24-hour scanning captures all planetary movements
- **Tiered Distribution**: Multiple quality levels instead of arbitrary limits
- **Enhanced Calendar Density**: 20-50+ events per month vs previous 12
- **Better Jupiter Coverage**: Hourly scanning ensures 2nd house placements are captured

### Remaining Considerations:
- Score thresholds still filter moderate alignments (intentionally)
- Title generation alternates between similar placements for variety
- Natural astronomical cycles affect planet visibility in houses

The algorithm now maximally utilizes increased computational power to provide users with comprehensive optimal timing opportunities throughout each month.

## Latest Enhancement: Planetary Dignities Integration

### What Was Added:
**Planetary dignity and debility scoring** has been integrated into the optimal timing algorithm to provide more astrologically accurate timing analysis.

### How It Works:
1. **Dignity Assessment**: For each planet, the algorithm checks its zodiac sign placement to determine dignity status
2. **Multiplier Application**: Scoring is enhanced based on planetary strength:
   - Planets in **rulership** (own sign) get 1.5x multiplier
   - Planets in **exaltation** (strongest sign) get 1.3x multiplier  
   - Planets in **detriment** (opposite sign) get 0.7x multiplier
   - Planets in **fall** (weakest sign) get 0.5x multiplier

### Impact on Results:
- **Higher Quality Timing**: Jupiter in Cancer (exalted) for money timing scores much higher than Jupiter in Capricorn (fall)
- **More Accurate Rankings**: Planets operating from strength are properly weighted higher
- **Better Calendar Density**: Strong planetary placements now rise to the top more reliably

### Examples:
- **Venus in Taurus (rulership)** for love timing: Base score × 1.5
- **Mars in Cancer (fall)** for career timing: Base score × 0.5  
- **Jupiter in Cancer (exaltation)** for money timing: Significantly boosted scores

This enhancement ensures the optimal timing algorithm reflects traditional astrological wisdom about planetary strength and weakness based on zodiac sign placement.

## Latest Enhancement: Combo Criteria System

### What Was Added:
**Planetary combination criteria** have been added to detect and score powerful multi-planet configurations in the same house.

### How It Works:
1. **Combo Definition**: Each priority can now define specific planetary combinations that provide bonus scoring
2. **House Matching**: All specified planets must be in the same target house to trigger the combo
3. **Bonus Scoring**: Combos provide significant bonus points (2.0-3.5x) when detected
4. **Dignity Enhancement**: Combo bonuses are multiplied by the average planetary dignity of all planets in the combo

### Example Combo Criteria:

#### Money Priority Combos:
- **Jupiter & Venus in 2nd House**: +1.5 bonus (ultimate wealth combination)
- **Jupiter & Sun in 2nd House**: +1.2 bonus (success and abundance)  
- **Venus & Sun in 8th House**: +1.0 bonus (investment success)

#### Love Priority Combos:
- **Venus & Jupiter in 7th House**: +1.2 bonus (perfect marriage energy)
- **Venus & Moon in 5th House**: +1.0 bonus (romance and attraction)
- **Venus & Jupiter in 5th House**: +1.1 bonus (joy and abundant love)

### Impact on Results:
- **Higher Scores**: When combo criteria are met, timing scores can exceed normal caps
- **Prioritized Titles**: Combo matches take precedence in event title generation
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: Combo descriptions replace generic aspect descriptions
- **Rare Opportunities**: Combos occur infrequently, making them truly special timing windows

### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
comboCriteria: [
  {
    id: 'jupiter_venus_2nd',
    name: 'Jupiter & Venus in 2nd House',
    description: 'Ultimate wealth combination - abundance and money together',
    planets: ['jupiter', 'venus'],
    house: 2,
    bonus: 3.0
  }
]
```

This allows users to capture astrologically significant multi-planet configurations that traditional astrology considers especially powerful for specific life areas.

## Latest Enhancement: Challenging Aspects & Combo Filtering

### What Was Added:
**Challenging aspects filtering** has been integrated to identify and penalize difficult planetary configurations, providing a more balanced astrological analysis.

### How It Works:
1. **Challenging Aspects**: Square and opposition aspects between priority planets now reduce timing scores
2. **Penalty System**: Challenging aspects receive -30% penalty (vs +50% bonus for favorable aspects)
3. **Challenging Combos**: Negative planetary combinations that warn against certain timing
4. **Warning System**: Challenging combos are prioritized in titles with ⚠️ warning symbols

### Challenging Aspects Added:
All priorities now filter for:
- **Square aspects**: Tension and obstacles between planets
- **Opposition aspects**: Conflict and imbalance between planetary energies

### Example Challenging Combos:

#### Money Priority:
- **⚠️ Mars & Saturn in 2nd House**: -1.2 penalty (financial restrictions, aggressive spending)
- **⚠️ Mars & Pluto in 8th House**: -1.5 penalty (high-risk investments, financial power struggles)

#### Love Priority:
- **⚠️ Mars & Saturn in 7th House**: -1.0 penalty (relationship conflicts, commitment issues)
- **⚠️ Mars & Pluto in 5th House**: -0.8 penalty (intense, possibly obsessive romantic energy)

### Impact on Results:
- **Balanced Scoring**: Both positive and negative influences are factored into timing quality
- **Warning System**: Challenging combinations are highlighted with ⚠️ symbols in event titles
- **Realistic Timing**: Users see both opportunities and potential difficulties
- **Lower Scores**: Times with challenging aspects receive appropriately reduced scores

### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
challengingAspects: ['square', 'opposition'],
comboCriteria: [
  {
    id: 'mars_saturn_2nd',
    name: 'Mars & Saturn in 2nd House',
    description: 'Financial restrictions and aggressive spending',
    planets: ['mars', 'saturn'],
    house: 2,
    bonus: -2.5,
    type: 'challenging'
  }
]
```

This enhancement provides more nuanced and realistic astrological timing analysis by considering both favorable and challenging planetary influences.

## Latest Fix: Balanced Combo Scoring (December 2024)

### Problem Identified:
Combo criteria bonuses were too large (2.0-3.5 points), causing combo events to completely dominate the results and crowding out regular planetary placement events.

### Solution Applied:
**Reduced combo bonuses to more reasonable levels:**
- Favorable combo bonuses: 1.0-1.5 points (was 2.0-3.5)
- Challenging combo penalties: 0.8-1.5 points (was 1.5-2.5)

### Impact:
- **Balanced Results**: Now generates both combo events AND regular planetary placement events
- **Better Variety**: Users see diverse timing opportunities including simple placements like "Jupiter 2nd" and special combos like "Jupiter & Venus in 2nd House"
- **Proper Distribution**: 20-50+ events per month with mix of event types rather than only combo events

## Latest Enhancement: Database Persistence & Bug Resolution (January 2025)

### What Was Fixed:
**Complete database persistence system** for astrological events with comprehensive error handling and automatic table/user creation.

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **Table Creation**: `astrological_events` table now automatically created if missing
2. **Foreign Key Constraints**: User records automatically created to satisfy database constraints  
3. **Timestamp Conversion**: Proper handling of Unix timestamps vs Date objects in database
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to local storage when database unavailable
5. **Bulk Operations**: Individual event insertion to avoid mock database bulk insert limitations

#### Technical Improvements:
- ✅ **EventService.createManyEvents**: Enhanced with automatic table and user creation
- ✅ **Database Initialization**: Robust connection handling with fallback modes
- ✅ **Data Conversion**: Proper timestamp handling between application and database formats
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Events save to local state when database operations fail
- ✅ **Foreign Key Management**: Automatic user record creation for anonymous users

### Previous Enhancement: Universal Electional Astrology Integration (December 2024)

### What Was Added:
**Full electional astrology system** based on traditional principles from the Electional.md analysis, implementing proper prohibition checks that apply universally to ALL timing priorities.

### Key Features:

#### 1. Universal Electional Mode
- **Third Timing Option**: "Electional" mode alongside "House-Based" and "Aspect-Based"
- **Applies to ALL Priorities**: Same electional rules whether seeking career, love, financial, or any other timing
- **Traditional Principles**: Based on centuries-old electional astrology wisdom

#### 2. Universal Electional Prohibitions (Apply to ALL Priorities)
```typescript
const universalProhibitions = [
  mercury_retrograde,      // 70% penalty - affects all communication, contracts, travel
  mars_saturn_opposition,  // 60% penalty - structural conflicts affect everything
  full_moon_new_venture,   // 40% penalty - wrong phase for ANY new beginning
  mars_debilitated,        // 30% penalty - weakened action affects all areas
  saturn_debilitated,      // 30% penalty - unstable foundations universally bad
  mercury_combust          // 20% penalty - unclear thinking affects all decisions
];
```

#### 3. Universal Moon Phase Scoring
```typescript
const defaultMoonPhaseMultipliers = {
  'new': 1.1,              // Good for new beginnings but can be weak
  'waxing_crescent': 1.4,  // BEST - growth and increase
  'first_quarter': 1.3,    // Good - action and momentum
  'waxing_gibbous': 1.2,   // Good - still growing
  'full': 0.6,             // AVOID - culmination and crisis
  'waning_gibbous': 0.8,   // Declining - better for releasing
  'last_quarter': 0.7,     // Declining - letting go
  'waning_crescent': 0.9   // Preparation phase
};
```

#### 4. Universal Favorable Conditions
- **Mercury Direct**: 20% bonus (benefits ALL activities requiring communication, travel, contracts)
- **Jupiter Dignified**: 15% bonus (expansion and luck benefit all endeavors)
- **Venus Dignified**: 10% bonus (harmony and attraction help everything flow)

#### 5. How Electional Mode Works
```typescript
const analyzeChartForElectionalTiming = (chartData, priorities, date) => {
  // 1. Check universal prohibitions (apply to ALL priorities)
  // 2. Calculate base score using regular priority analysis
  // 3. Apply universal Moon phase multipliers
  // 4. Check universal favorable conditions
  // 5. Return final electional score
};
```

### Technical Implementation:

#### Utility Functions:
```typescript
const isRetrograde = (planetData) => planetData.velocity < 0;
const getMoonPhase = (date) => { /* simplified lunar cycle calculation */ };
const isCombust = (planet, sun) => Math.abs(planet.longitude - sun.longitude) <= 8;
```

#### Enhanced Analysis Function:
```typescript
const analyzeChartForElectionalTiming = (chartData, priorities, date, showDebug) => {
  // 1. Check prohibitions and apply penalties
  // 2. Calculate base score using house/aspect analysis
  // 3. Apply Moon phase multipliers
  // 4. Check required conditions for bonuses
  // 5. Return final electional score
};
```

### Impact on Results:

#### Universal Application:
- **ALL Priorities Affected**: Whether seeking career, love, financial, health, or any other timing
- **Consistent Standards**: Same electional principles apply regardless of life area
- **Traditional Wisdom**: Based on centuries of astrological practice

#### Score Quality Improvements:
- **Mercury Retrograde**: ALL activities penalized during retrograde (contracts, communication, travel, new ventures)
- **Malefic Oppositions**: Mars-Saturn conflicts affect ALL areas of life
- **Moon Phases**: Waxing preferred for ALL new beginnings, not just specific types
- **Planetary Dignity**: Weak planets affect their significations in ALL contexts

#### User Experience:
- **Simple Mode Selection**: Choose "Electional" to apply traditional timing wisdom
- **Universal Warnings**: See ⚠️ symbols for challenging periods across all priorities
- **Educational Value**: Learn why certain times are universally challenging or favorable
- **Professional Standards**: Aligns with what professional astrologers would advise

### Example Scoring Impact (ANY Priority):
```
Base Score (House/Aspect Analysis): 5.0 points

Electional Mode Modifiers:
× 0.3 (Mercury Retrograde) = 1.5 points
× 0.6 (Full Moon) = 0.9 points  
× 0.7 (Mars in Fall) = 0.63 points

OR with favorable conditions:
× 1.2 (Mercury Direct) = 6.0 points
× 1.4 (Waxing Crescent) = 8.4 points
× 1.15 (Jupiter Exalted) = 9.66 points → capped at 10.0
```

### Why Universal Application Matters:

1. **Mercury Retrograde** affects:
   - Career: Contracts, negotiations, job applications
   - Love: Communication, meeting new people, commitments
   - Financial: Investments, major purchases, agreements
   - Travel: Bookings, schedules, navigation
   - ALL areas requiring clear communication

2. **Full Moon** is challenging for:
   - ANY new beginning (it's a culmination phase)
   - Starting businesses, relationships, projects
   - Making major life changes
   - Initiating long-term commitments

3. **Malefic Oppositions** create:
   - Structural conflicts in ALL areas
   - Stop-start energy affecting any endeavor
   - Frustration and obstacles universally

### Integration Points:
- **Mode Selection**: Three-column UI (Houses | Aspects | Electional)
- **No Special Cases**: Electional mode treats all priorities equally
- **Backwards Compatible**: Other modes unchanged
- **Clear Documentation**: Debug logs explain each prohibition

This enhancement transforms the optimal timing system into a true electional astrology tool that applies professional-grade timing principles universally, ensuring users get traditional astrological guidance regardless of their specific life priority.

## Latest Update: Magic Formula System Disabled (January 2025)

### What Was Changed:
**Magic Formula system temporarily disabled** due to astronomical reality. Jupiter and Pluto are not in aspect during 2025, making Magic Formula detection astronomically impossible.

### Astronomical Context:
- **Last Jupiter-Pluto conjunction**: 2020 (in Capricorn)
- **Current separation (2025)**: ~215° apart - no aspect possible
- **Next Jupiter-Pluto conjunction**: ~2033-2035
- **System Status**: Magic Formula bonuses disabled to prevent false positives

### System Changes Made:

#### 1. Magic Formula Bonus Calculation Disabled:
```typescript
const calculateMagicFormulaBonus = (chartData: any, priorities: string[], showDebug = false): number => {
  // Magic Formula disabled - Jupiter and Pluto are not in aspect during 2025
  // Last conjunction was 2020, next will be ~2033-2035
  // Individual planet bonuses also disabled to prevent false positives
  
  return 0; // No Magic Formula bonus until Jupiter-Pluto aspects return
};
```

#### 2. Title Generation Cleaned:
```typescript
export const generateAstrologicalTitle = (...) => {
  // Magic Formula detection removed - Jupiter-Pluto aspects not astronomically active in 2025
  // Next Jupiter-Pluto conjunction ~2033-2035
  
  // For aspects mode, prioritize aspect-based titles
  if (timingMode === 'aspects') {
    return generateAspectBasedTitle(chartData, priorities, description, eventIndex);
  }
  // ... normal title generation continues
};
```

#### 3. Debug Logging Removed:
All `console.log` statements removed from:
- `/src/hooks/optimalTiming/chartAnalyzers.ts`
- `/src/hooks/optimalTiming/titleGenerators.ts`  
- `/src/utils/natalChart.ts`

### Impact on Current Events Generation:

#### **Current System Behavior (2025):**
- **No Magic Formula bonuses**: All events scored using standard planetary placements and aspects
- **Clean console output**: No debug logging cluttering the browser console
- **Normal event titles**: Events use regular planetary placement titles (e.g., "Jupiter 2nd · 🌊 Growth Moon")
- **Standard thresholds**: Score thresholds remain at 0.8+ (houses), 0.5+ (aspects), 0.6+ (electional)

#### **Moon Electional Context Integration:**
Enhanced event titles now include Moon sign electional guidance:
```typescript
// Add Moon electional context to title
const moonPlanet = chartData.planets.find((p: PlanetPosition) => p.name === 'moon');
if (moonPlanet?.sign) {
  const moonContext = getMoonElectionalContext(moonPlanet.sign);
  if (moonContext) {
    title += ` · ${moonContext}`;
  }
}
```

**Moon Context Examples:**
- 🌊 Growth Moon (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) - water signs for growth
- 🌱 Strength Moon (Taurus) - earth for strength  
- ✂️ Precision Moon (Virgo) - for maintenance/precision work
- ✈️ Travel Moon (Gemini, Sagittarius) - mutable for flexibility
- 🎯 Action Moon (Aries, Libra, Capricorn) - cardinal for initiation
- 🎨 Creative Moon (Leo) - fire for creativity

### When Magic Formula Will Return:

The Magic Formula system remains in the codebase and will automatically reactivate when Jupiter-Pluto aspects become astronomically available:

#### **Future Reactivation (~2033-2035):**
- **detectMagicFormula()** function preserved and ready
- **Scoring bonuses** can be re-enabled by removing the `return 0;` override
- **Title generation** can be restored by uncommenting the Magic Formula checks
- **Special symbols** (🎭 ⚡) ready for future use

#### **System Readiness:**
All Magic Formula infrastructure remains intact for future astronomical cycles:
- Complete detection logic at `/src/hooks/optimalTiming/financialAstrologyCalculations.ts`
- Integration points in all analysis methods
- Special title generation ready for reactivation
- Priority override system prepared for Jupiter-Pluto conjunctions
